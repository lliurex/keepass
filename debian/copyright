 #######**** NOTE THIS ADD-ON ****#######
 The GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL is written for software libraries
 in the first place. The LGPL has to be considered valid for this artwork
 library too.
 Nuvola icon theme for KDE 3.x is a special kind of software library, it is an
 artwork library, it's elements can be used in a Graphical User Interface, or
 GUI.
 Source code, for this library means:
 - raster png image* .
 The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry
 notices. With images this is in some cases impossible or hardly usefull.
 With this library a notice is placed at a prominent place in the directory
 containing the elements. You may follow this practice.
 The exception in section 6 of the GNU Lesser General Public License covers
 the use of elements of this art library in a GUI.
